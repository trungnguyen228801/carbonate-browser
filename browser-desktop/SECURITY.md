# Security Checklist

This document outlines the security measures implemented in Carbonate Browser and provides a checklist for security reviews and releases.

## Security Architecture

### Main Process Security
- **Context Isolation**: Enabled to prevent renderer access to Node.js APIs
- **Node Integration**: Disabled in renderer process
- **Preload Script**: Secure bridge between main and renderer processes
- **IPC Validation**: All IPC channels are whitelisted and validated
- **URL Validation**: All URLs are validated before navigation
- **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs are sanitized before processing

### Renderer Process Security
- **No Node.js Access**: Renderer cannot access Node.js APIs directly
- **CSP Headers**: Content Security Policy implemented
- **XSS Protection**: Input sanitization and output encoding
- **Safe DOM Manipulation**: All DOM operations are validated
- **Secure Communication**: Only whitelisted IPC channels allowed

### Extension Security
- **Manifest Validation**: All extension manifests are validated
- **Permission Model**: Whitelist-based permission system
- **Sandboxed Execution**: Extensions run in isolated contexts
- **Content Script Isolation**: Content scripts cannot access main process
- **API Restrictions**: Limited API surface for extensions
